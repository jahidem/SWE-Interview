There are two important notes:
1. Some materials are outdated (but some ain't, like Clean Code). If you have more recent versions of good studying materials or just something that **really** helped **you personally**â€”please, share them in the https://discord.com/channels/950701840901746708/1258453220615786688 channel (and send a copy to p.lebedev@itransition.com). I promise that a good deed will not go unnoticed.
Try to use studing material exclusively in English. Well, that's IT for you. Without the ability to consume technical English content, you won't be able to work. Fortunately, it's always the simplest _technical_ English.

And I highly recommend to study the following topics also for everybody â€” they are not exactly parts of two month survival course, but they will be VERY useful in your future software engineering career (you can buy video materials or corresponding books for yourself,  you can try to find some student discounts or free transcriptions or alternative versions):
1. **Clean Code**. The legendary Clean Code series is here â€” https://cleancoders.com/ (the price is pretty steep, but it worth it, don't be fooled by the Uncle Bob's hats, jokes and distractions, the content is a real treasure). There are also books by Robert C. Martin, they are good â€” I personally prefer videos, but every man to his taste. If you can't find the money or free version, read at least the check list here: https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29 (but it can't replace video, don't fool yourself). Of course, there are a lot of videos in Clean Code, if you can watch only some of them, watch the first 14.
1. **Design Patterns.** There is a good introductory book â€” Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide. Also you can browse and study online-catalog here â€” https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns.
1. **Regular Expressions**. There are a lot of books (e.g., Mastering Regular Expressions), but I recommend the following free sites: https://regexone.com/, https://www.regular-expressions.info/.
